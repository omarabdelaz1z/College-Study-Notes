# Chapter Two: Investigating System Requirements

**Technology Architecture**: *a set of computing hardware, network hardware and topology and system software - AKA equipment - employed by an organization*.

**Application Architecture**: *a set of information systems the organization needs to support its strategic plan.*



- All organizations face a difficult challenge keeping all their information systems current and effective.

- Due to an organization resource limitation, The organization's technology architecture and application architecture will include a mix of old and new architectures.

- A system analyst needs to complete some activities to help the organization to accomplish their desired requirements.
  

- <u>Types of Analysis Activities:</u>

  1. ***Gather Detailed Information.***

  2. ***Define Requirements.***

  3. ***Prioritize Requirements.***

  4. ***Develop UI dialogs.***

  5. ***Evaluate Requirements with users.***


1. ***Gather Detailed Information***

 Analysts usually do:

1. ***Ask everyone who will use the new system or used similar systems -old ones-*.**
2. ***Obtain additional information about other companies which have the same business needs***
3. ***Identify and understand activities of current and future users who will use the system and their future locations both inside and outside the organization*.** 



***Note: The analyst must become an expert in the business area the system will support.*** 

2. ***Define Requirements***

- Analysts use information gathered to define the new system requirements.

- The Analyst usually do:
  	1. ***Create models to record requirements.***
   	2. ***Review models created with users.***
   	3. ***Refine and expand the models - after the review - to reflect new or updated information***.


<u>Types of Requirements:</u>

- ***Functional Requirements.***
- ***Nonfunctional Requirements.***

<u>Types of Requirement Models:</u>

- ***Use Case Diagrams.***
- ***Activity Diagrams.***
- ***Domain model class diagrams.***

- ***Prioritize Requirements***
  - Prioritizing most crucial requirements for the system. To achieve this goal, If an analyst understand the organization and the work done by the users, the analyst will have more insight toward.
  - Requirements priorities help to determine the number, composition and ordering of the project iterations. Note that many high-priority requirements increase the number of iterations of project.
  - More suggestions leads to expand software requirements known as ***Scope Creep***.

3. ***Develop UI Dialogs***

   - Users have difficulties to interpret and validate abstract models. So a user interface become handy and reliable for user validation as user can see and feel the system.

   - Developing user-interface dialogs is a powerful method of eliciting and documenting requirements.

   - Interaction diagrams, Written Dialogs, Storyboards and UI Prototypes are types of user interface models.

   - Any developed prototype can be expanded in later iterations to become a fully functioning part of the system.
     

4. ***Evaluate Requirements with Users***

   - The processes of eliciting requirements, building models and prototypes, and evaluating them with users may repeat many
     times until requirements models and prototypes are complete and accurate.

     

- **System Requirements**: *the new system activities that must perform and the constraints that must be met (functional + nonfunctional)*.

- **Functional Requirements**: *all the activities, business rules or uses cases the system must perform to support users' work.*

- Identifying and describing all these business uses require a substantial amount of time and effort because the list of functions and their dependencies can be very complex.

- Functional requirements are also **based on the procedures and rules that an organization uses** to run its business.

- Modifying the system after customers start complaining is **much more difficult and expensive** than building in the rule from the start.

- **Nonfunctional Requirements**: *all system characteristics that are required. These characteristics are defined in the keyword "**FURPS**"*

  FURBS is acronym for:

  - Functional: Functional requirements.

  - Usability: User Interface, Online Help, Multilanguage Support and Documentation.

  - Reliability: How often a system behave towards unexpected behaviors and incorrect processing and how it detects and recovers from it.

  - Performance: Workload such as throughput, response time.

  - Security: How a system protects data during storage and transmission.
    

- **FURPS+**: *is an extension of FURPS that adds additional categories, including design constraints as well as implementation, system interface, physical, and supportability requirements—all these additional categories summarized by the plus sign.*

  - **Extensions such as**: **Design constraints, Interface requirements, Physical requirements and Supportability requirements.**


- **Stakeholders**: *persons who have an interest in the successful implementation of the system because they are the primary source of system requirements*

  - **Example of Stakeholders:** bookkeepers, accountants, managers and executives, customers, suppliers, auditors, investors and etc.

  - **Types of Stakeholders**:

    - **Internal Stakeholders**: *Within the organization such as employees, students and volunteers.*

    - **External Stakeholders**: *Outside the organization such as suppliers and shipping companies.*

    - **Operational Stakeholders**: *Those who interact with a system directly in their jobs such as accountants, factory supervisors, customers and patients.*

    - **Executive Stakeholders**: *persons who don’t interact directly with the system but who either use information produced by the system or have a significant financial or other interest in its operation and success.*

      - include an organization’s senior managers and board of directors, regulatory agencies, and taxing authorities.

- **Client**: *a person or group that provides the funding for the system development project*.

-  **Information-Gathering Techniques**:
  1. Interviewing users and other stakeholders.
  2. Distributing and collecting questionnaires.
  3. Reviewing inputs, outputs, and documentation.
  4. Observing and documenting business procedures.
  5. Researching vendor solutions.
  6. Collecting active user comments and suggestions.

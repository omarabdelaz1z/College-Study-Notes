# Chapter Two: Investigating System Requirements

#### <u>Introduction</u>

​	**Technology Architecture**: *a set of computing hardware, network hardware and topology and system software employed by an organization*.

​	**Application Architecture**: *a set of information systems the organization needs to support its strategic plan.*

#### <u>System Analysis Activities</u> 

- All organizations face a difficult challenge keeping all their information systems current and effective.

- Due to an organization resource limitation, The organization's technology architecture and application architecture will include a mix of old and new architectures.

- A system analyst needs to complete some activities to help the organization to accomplish their desired requirements.

- <u>Types of Analysis Activities:</u>

  1. ***Gather Detailed Information.***

  2. ***Define Requirements.***

  3. ***Prioritize Requirements.***

  4. ***Develop UI dialogs.***

  5. ***Evaluate Requirements with users.***

     

1. ***Gather Detailed Information***

    Analysts usually do:

   1. ***Ask everyone who will use the new system or used similar systems -old ones-*.**
   2. ***Obtain additional information about other companies which have the same business needs***
   3. ***Identify and understand activities of current and future users who will use the system and their future locations both inside and outside the organization*.** 



​		**Note**: *The analyst must become an expert in the business area the system will support.*

2. ***Define Requirements***

- Analysts use information gathered to define the new system requirements.

- The Analyst usually do:
  1. ***Create models to record requirements.***
  2. ***Review models created with users.***
  3. ***Refine and expand the models - after the review - to reflect new or updated information***.
     
     

<u>Types of Requirements:</u>

- ***Functional Requirements.***
- ***Nonfunctional Requirements.***

<u>Types of Requirement Models:</u>

- ***Use Case Diagrams.***
- ***Activity Diagrams.***
- ***Domain model class diagrams.***

- ***Prioritize Requirements***
  - Prioritizing most crucial requirements for the system. To achieve this goal, If an analyst understand the organization and the work done by the users, the analyst will have more insight toward.
  - Requirements priorities help to determine the number, composition and ordering of the project iterations. Note that many high-priority requirements increase the number of iterations of project.
  - More suggestions leads to expand software requirements known as <u>***Scope Creep***.</u>

3. ***Develop UI Dialogs***

   - Users have difficulties to interpret and validate abstract models. So a user interface become handy and reliable for user validation as user can see and feel the system.

   - Developing user-interface dialogs is a powerful method of eliciting and documenting requirements.

   - Interaction diagrams, Written Dialogs, Storyboards and UI Prototypes are types of user interface models.

   - Any developed prototype can be expanded in later iterations to become a fully functioning part of the system.

4. ***Evaluate Requirements with Users***

   - The processes of eliciting requirements, building models and prototypes, and evaluating them with users may repeat many
     times until requirements models and prototypes are complete and accurate.

#### <u>What Are Requirements?</u>

- **System Requirements**: *the new system activities that must perform and the constraints that must be met (functional + nonfunctional)*.

- **Functional Requirements**: *all the activities, business rules or uses cases the system must perform to support users' work.*

- Identifying and describing all these business uses require a substantial amount of time and effort because the list of functions and their dependencies can be very complex.

- Functional requirements are also **based on the procedures and rules that an organization uses** to run its business.

- Modifying the system after customers start complaining is **much more difficult and expensive** than building in the rule from the start.

- **Nonfunctional Requirements**: *all system characteristics that are required. These characteristics are defined in the keyword "**FURPS**"*

  FURBS is acronym for:

  - Functional: Functional requirements.

  - Usability: User Interface, Online Help, Multilanguage Support and Documentation.

  - Reliability: How often a system behave towards unexpected behaviors and incorrect processing and how it detects and recovers from it.

  - Performance: Workload such as throughput, response time.

  - Security: How a system protects data during storage and transmission.

- **FURPS+**: *is an extension of FURPS that adds additional categories, including design constraints as well as implementation, system interface, physical, and supportability requirements—all these additional categories summarized by the plus sign.*

  - **Extensions such as**: **Design constraints, Interface requirements, Physical requirements and Supportability requirements.**

#### <u>Stakeholders</u>


- **Stakeholders**: *persons who have an interest in the successful implementation of the system because they are the primary source of system requirements*

  - **Example of Stakeholders:** bookkeepers, accountants, managers and executives, customers, suppliers, auditors, investors and etc.

  - <u>Types of Stakeholders:</u>

    - **Internal Stakeholders**: *Within the organization such as employees, students and volunteers.*

    - **External Stakeholders**: *Outside the organization such as suppliers and shipping companies.*

    - **Operational Stakeholders**: *Those who interact with a system directly in their jobs such as accountants, factory supervisors, customers and patients.*

    - **Executive Stakeholders**: *persons who don’t interact directly with the system but who either use information produced by the system or have a significant financial or other interest in its operation and success.*

      - include an organization’s senior managers and board of directors, regulatory agencies, and taxing authorities.


    - **Client**: *a person or group that provides the funding for the system development project*.

#### <u>**Information-Gathering Techniques**</u>

- All information about system requirements can be collected using the following techniques:

1. ***Interviewing users and other stakeholders:*** 

   - Considered the **most time consuming** technique.

   - An **effective way** to understand business functions/rules.

   - In a successful/effective interview, the analyst do **a checklist to summarize the major points to be covered** to facilitate the interview process.

   - <u>Types of Questions Themes:</u>

     - What are the business processes? 

       **Goal**: *Identify which processes are fundamental to keep or processes to eliminate*.

     - How those operations are performed?: 

       **Goal**: *to attain the new system functionalities to perform business processes.*

     - What information is needed to perform these operations? 

       **Goal**: *identify the unusual situations and the nitty-gritty detail to develop a correct solution.*

   - <u>Types of Questions:</u>

     - **Open-Ended Questions**: *questions that encourage discussion or explanation*.

       **Goal**: *identify a number of uncovered requirements quickly.*

     - **Closed-Ended Questions**: *questions that elicit specific facts.*

       **Goal**: *Confirm specific details of a business process.*

   - Note: Since **a new system could inherit from** many or all the requirements **from an existing system**, Therefore, An analyst must balance **the review of current business functions with discovery of new system requirements**.

   - For more reading, read p.52 of conducting the interview and following up the interview.

2. *Distributing and collecting questionnaires.*

   - Questionnaires help/enable the analyst to define requirements from a large number of stakeholders.
   - The questionnaire could have any type of questions discussed above.
   - Stakeholders frequently don't return questionnaires that contain many open-ended questions. This type of questions is preferable in the interview not in a questionnaire.

3. *Reviewing inputs, outputs, and documentation.*

   - Review process helps to find *'best practices'* studies.
   - Get preliminary understanding of the inputs and outputs of a process to gain a visual insight.

   - Two sources of information can be gathered from:
     - ***External***: *industry-wide professional organizations and other companies.*
     - ***Internal***: *Within the organization*

4. *Observing and documenting business procedures.*

   - Observing a business process in action will help the analyst to understand the business functions.
   - An Analyst must also be able to visualize the new system’s associated business processes.
   - It is not necessary to observe all processes at the same level of detail.
   - Some processes would take a quick walk-through and some is critical to an extended observation.

5. *Researching vendor solutions.*

   - Best practices of a vendor that are used to solve a business problem. 

6. *Collecting active user comments and suggestions.*

   - User feedback from initial and later testing is a valuable source of requirements information.
   - By interaction, users can give concrete suggestions for improvement and identify missing or poorly implemented requirements.

#### <u>Models and Modeling</u>

- **Model**: *representation or abstraction of some aspect of a system.*

- Models may vary based on the project, some models won't need to show every aspect/detail of a system and some projects do need more models.

- Modeling is an important part of systems analysis and design.

- Analysts use models to describe system requirements and communicate with them with users and designers.

- If the user spots omissions, they are incorporated into the model before it becomes the basis for subsequent design and implementation activities.

- <u>Types of Models</u>: 

  - **Textual Models**: *text-based system models such as memos, reports, narratives, event lists and use case descriptions.*
    - Used when system requirements are detailed and difficult to represent in other ways.

  - **Graphical Models**: *system models that use pictures and other graphical elements to create a diagram.*
    - Used to demonstrate system entities - in an abstract way - with their complex relationships such as  external agents, processes,
      data, objects, messages, and connections.

  - **Mathematical Models**: *system models that describes technical aspects of a system using mathematical expressions*.
    - Used to represent **functional requirements** for scientific and engineering applications and occasionally used to describe business system requirements in areas such as accounting and inventory control.
    - Used to describe **nonfunctional requirements** and operational parameters such as **network  throughput** or **database query response time**.

  - **Unified Modelling Language (UML)**: *a standard set of information system model constructs and notations defined by the Object Management  Group.*
    - Examples: **<u>Use Case Diagram</u>, <u>Class Diagram</u>, <u>Activity Diagram</u>, <u>Sequence Diagram</u>, <u>Communication Diagram</u> and <u>State Machine Diagram</u>**

  

#### <u>Documenting Workflows with Activity Diagrams</u>

- After the process of gather information about business processes, An analyst need to document the results by using any of the following ways:

  - **Workflow**: *a sequence of work steps that completely handle one business transaction or customer request*. 
    - These workflows may include participants from different parts of the organization.
  - **Activity Diagram:** *UML diagram describes the system activities and the actors participate in this activity.*
    - Activity diagram consists of **Synchronization Bar **and **Swimlane**. 

- See the examples in the book p.60 :p.63.

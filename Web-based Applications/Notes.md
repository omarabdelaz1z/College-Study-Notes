## Introduction

#### Important Factors in IS Implementation

- System Architecture
  - Distributed
  - Various Servers and Various Clients
- Application Type
  - Business Logic 
  - UI (Front end layer)
  - Data Persistence and Modelling (Back end layer)
- Software Development Emphasis
  - Persistence
  - Accuracy
  - User Friendly GUI

#### Components of IS Architecture

- UI 
  - Dumb Terminal (CLI)
  - X - Terminal (Early GUI such as UNIX systems)
  - PCs
  - Mobile Phones/ Tablets
- Data Management
- Data Processing (Computation) 

#### Definitions 

**The Web**: is acronym for World Wide Web, It's a way of sharing information through the internet via Internet protocols such as ***HTTP as  data transfer protocol*** and ***HTML as a markup language for publishing and formatting web pages.***  

**The Internet:** an enormous global network of  billions interconnected computers and servers using a valid IP address.

#### Why Distributed (Decentralized) Systems

- Most businesses are already distributed.
- Makes services closer and available to customers who need these services.
- Consolidate the power of PCs  across the enterprise.
- User-friendly because they use the PC as the user interface processor.
- Total Cost of owning a distributed system is at least as expensive, because personal computers and network servers are less expensive than mainframe computers

#### Why Not Distributed (Decentralized) Systems

- Lots of network traffic.
- Security and Integrity more easily to compromise.

#### Notes

- Identifying server machine is done by DNS

- Identifying Clients is done by identifying IP addresses of the clients

#### Why Java

- Platform Independent
